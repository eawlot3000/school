#### Real Talk:
# Everyone deserves human rights, including my peoples back in China.

```markdown
... But you are not at all like us. 

With everything to lose, you wait patiently for them to come, and follow into their car. 

You walk into the Machine.

Your act is still reverberating around the world.

And our silence is deafening behind the firewall.

Will you, The Bridge Man, meet the same fate as The Tank Man, mere 33 years ago in this very land?

I think I know the answer yet I don't have the courage to face it.
