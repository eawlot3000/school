## I might not did this Lab3 perfectly. Now troubleshooting for:
## in **index.html** file

1. line 66: I never had chance to use main tag
2. line 39-42: I had inline css of (p a) section for email part in line 103, but the "text-align: center" dont work. i dont know why.
3. The header part of the html page doesn't looks right. There might be a problem in header tag. But I just followed the pdf doc, I don't know what happened.

Thank you for answering.
